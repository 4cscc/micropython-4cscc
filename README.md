4CSCC Development code for deployment of Raspberry Pi Pico W devices.

scripts rely on a `config.json` file at the top-level on the Pico W. The format should look like the following (with values filled in):

```
{"wifi": {"ssid": "", "password": ""},
 "inst": {"access-key": "",
          "bucket-key": ""},
 "host-id": ""
 }
```

Additional documentation to follow.
